# User Journey & Information Architecture

This document explains how a hardware startup founder moves through the platform—from initial intent to confident commitment—and how information is structured at each stage to reduce uncertainty, prevent over- or under-hiring, and build trust.

---

## Target User

The primary user is a **hardware or electronics startup founder** who:
- Has a clear idea or an ongoing product
- Possesses funding and business connections
- Lacks deep on-ground technical execution skills
- Is unsure whom to hire, how many people to hire, and when to hire them

The founder’s biggest fear is **making costly hiring mistakes that delay execution**.

---

## Entry Point & User Intent

### User Intent
The founder arrives at the platform with a broad question:
> “I have an idea or product, but I don’t know what technical skills I need or who I can trust to execute it.”

They are not looking to browse talent randomly—they are seeking **clarity, guidance, and confidence**.

---

## Step-by-Step User Journey

### Step 1: Landing on the Portal (Intent Recognition)
- The platform positions itself as an *execution partner*, not a hiring marketplace.
- Messaging focuses on solving execution confusion rather than selling talent.
- Primary CTA: *“Get Execution Guidance”* or *“Diagnose My Project”*

**Why this step exists:**  
To reassure the founder that they don’t need to know everything upfront.

---

### Step 2: Project Intake & Problem Definition
The founder is guided through a short, structured input flow:
- Startup stage (idea, prototype, pilot, production)
- Type of product or problem statement
- Approximate team size expectation (if any)
- Budget range and execution urgency
- Preferred city or operational location

**Why this step exists:**  
To reduce ambiguity and capture only the information necessary for meaningful guidance—without overwhelming the user.

---

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Diagnosis & Execution Roadmap
Based on the inputs, the system generates:
- A recommended execution roadmap
- Required roles vs optional roles
- Suggested hiring sequence (what to hire now vs later)

Example outputs:
- “You do not need QA at this stage”
- “Embedded + PCB roles should overlap for 4–6 weeks”

**Why this step exists:**  
This directly addresses over-hiring and under-hiring by helping founders understand *what* is needed *and when*.

---

### Step 4: Budgeting & Effort Clarity
The platform presents a high-level budgeting view:
- Estimated cost ranges per role or cluster
- Time commitments per phase
- Comparison between individual hiring vs cluster-based execution

**Why this step exists:**  
Founders often burn capital due to poor estimation. Early visibility builds trust and sets realistic expectations.

---

### Step 5: Recommendation — Cluster vs Individual
Using project complexity, budget, and availability, the system recommends:
- **Clusters** for multi-disciplinary or tightly coupled execution
- **Individuals** for focused, short-term needs

The recommendation is clearly explained, not forced.

**Why this step exists:**  
To reduce decision fatigue and guide founders toward the most reliable execution model.

---

### Step 6: Discovery & Comparison
The founder can now:
- View vetted clusters or individual experts
- Compare based on specialization, past work, and city proximity
- See trust signals such as verification, domain match, and execution history

**Why this step exists:**  
Discovery happens *after* clarity—so comparison feels manageable and meaningful.

---

### Step 7: Commitment Without Pressure
Instead of a hard hire, the platform enables soft commitment actions:
- Book an online discovery call
- Request a proposal
- Reserve availability for a time window

**Why this step exists:**  
High-trust decisions require gradual commitment, not instant checkout.

---

## Information Architecture (IA)

The information architecture follows **progressive disclosure**, showing only what the user needs at each stage.

### Early Stage Information
- Problem framing
- Reassurance
- High-level guidance

### Mid Stage Information
- Role clarity
- Execution roadmap
- Budget and effort ranges

### Late Stage Information
- Profiles and comparisons
- Trust signals
- Clear next actions

This structure ensures the founder is never overwhelmed or forced to guess.

---

## Key Trust Moments in the Journey

- During project diagnosis (clarity over assumptions)
- When showing role recommendations (logic over sales)
- When explaining cluster vs individual trade-offs
- Before asking the founder to commit time or money

Trust is built gradually, not assumed.

---

## Summary

The user journey is designed to **guide founders before asking them to decide**.  
By diagnosing the project first and structuring information carefully, the platform transforms a risky hiring decision into a confident execution step.

The focus is not on speed, but on **clarity, trust, and execution readiness**.
