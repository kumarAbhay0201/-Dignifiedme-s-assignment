# Key UX Decisions

This document outlines three foundational UX decisions made while designing the City-Based Execution Marketplace. Each decision focuses on reducing execution risk, improving trust, and helping founders move forward with confidence.

## UX Decision 1: Project Diagnosis and Execution Roadmap Before Hiring

**Decision**  
Before showing any freelancers or clusters, the platform requires founders to go through a short project diagnosis flow that captures startup stage, problem statement, budget range, and execution goals. Based on this, the system generates a recommended execution roadmap.

**Problem Addressed**  
Founders often do not know:
- What technical roles are required
- How many engineers to hire
- When each role should be hired  

This leads to over-hiring, under-hiring, unnecessary cash burn, and stalled execution.

**Impact on Risk & Trust**  
By clarifying roles, skills, and hiring sequence upfront, the platform reduces guesswork and prevents costly hiring mistakes. Founders feel guided rather than judged, which builds early trust and positions the platform as an execution partner instead of a job board.

**Trade-Off**  
This approach adds friction before talent discovery and delays instant browsing. However, this trade-off is intentional, as clarity and confidence are more valuable than speed in high-stakes hardware execution decisions.

## UX Decision 2: City-Based Talent Discovery with Clusters and Individuals

**Decision**  
The platform limits discovery to city-specific freelancers and pre-vetted execution clusters instead of offering a global, open marketplace.

**Problem Addressed**  
Hardware execution often requires:
- On-ground coordination
- Physical installation, testing, or iteration
- Local availability for faster communication  

Global hiring increases coordination cost, delays, and execution risk.

**Impact on Risk & Trust**  
City-based discovery improves accountability, lowers operational friction, and increases productivity. Clusters further reduce coordination overhead by offering pre-aligned teams instead of disconnected individuals.

**Trade-Off**  
This decision limits the size of the talent pool. However, relevance and execution reliability are prioritized over volume, which is more suitable for hardware-focused startups.

## UX Decision 3: Low-Commitment Progression (Meetings Before Payments)

**Decision**  
Instead of forcing immediate payment or hiring, the platform allows founders to first book meetings, request proposals, or reserve availability before any financial commitment.

**Problem Addressed**  
Founders fear:
- Paying before trust is established
- Freelancer no-shows or mismatched expectations
- Financial disputes early in the process  

Freelancers also fear non-payment and wasted effort.

**Impact on Conversion & Trust**  
This gradual commitment model reduces anxiety on both sides. Founders feel safer exploring options, while freelancers gain clarity before engagement. Optional escrow or trusted payment mechanisms can be introduced only after mutual confirmation.

**Trade-Off**  
The hiring process may take slightly longer. However, this approach improves decision quality, reduces churn, and increases long-term platform credibility.

## Summary

These UX decisions intentionally slow down early actions to improve clarity, trust, and execution confidence. The platform is designed to guide founders before asking them to commit—transforming risky hiring decisions into structured execution steps.
